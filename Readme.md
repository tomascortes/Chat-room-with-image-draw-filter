# Chat Room using python:school_satchel:

## General considerations :octocat:

The program consists of a client server interface that can log people
save your profile pictures, apply a drawing filter to them, start waiting rooms
to play and open a chat in which everyone in the room communicates
waiting, where the boss can start it, and it is updated if the members
they go out.


To execute this task, the server main must be executed and then the client main.


## Execution :computer:
The main module of the task to execute is ```main.py``` in the server folder
and ```main.py``` in the client folder, the server must be run first.
